# easy_portscan
Easy one liner for creating a netcat port scanner on captured machines during CTFs.
A proxy is not required, but this port scanner was designed to be used in situations where the user is port scanning through a proxy, such as with Proxychains.

Included are the bash script, a one-liner text file for generating the script through a shell by copy/paste, and a photo demonstrating use.
